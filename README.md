# PSO
Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The implementation is done in C language and a header file contains the code. The optimization algorithm can be used by any one by simply including this header file in their code.
The pso.h file contains the algorithm for PSO and demco.c file has code to run and check performance of algorithm on few benchmark functions.
